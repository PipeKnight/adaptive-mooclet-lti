Django
------
Note: I "pre-loaded" the Django server with about 500 different simulated "ratings" given by
students of the 2 different explanations.

100 submit_result_of_version requests in 6.83 seconds ==> 14.6 requests/sec
100 get_version_of_component requests in 7.327 seconds ==> 13.6 requests/sec

Google Apps Script + Google Sheets
----------------------------------
1 get_version_of_component request in 2-5 seconds (varies highly) == > 0.2-0.5 requests/sec
	 - note that this test had to be done manually since Google thwarts
	   attempts to contact their URLs in a script.
